##Points to evaluate:

1) Which model has a lower loss?

According to the model performance results, the model used closing prices for the prediction has a lower loss (4.3%) vs the model used fng values (9.9%).

2) Which model tracks the actual values better over time?

According to the visualization results for each model for the same period (march - may, 2019), both models reflected the actual prices pretty accurately. 

3) Which window size works best for the model?

After running the models with different window size values (used 2, 4 and 6), it was determined that the higher the number of the window the less noise was reflected on the prediction of the price.
